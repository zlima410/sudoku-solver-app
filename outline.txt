Setup Django Backend:

Install Django and set up a new Django project.
Define a Django model for storing Sudoku puzzles and their solutions.
Create Django views and endpoints for interacting with Sudoku puzzles (e.g., generating puzzles, solving puzzles).
Implement Sudoku solving algorithms in Django.


Setup React Frontend:

Set up a new React project.
Create React components for displaying Sudoku puzzles and user interface elements.
Implement functionality to fetch data from the Django backend (using AJAX or Axios).
Implement user interactions (e.g., inputting numbers, submitting solutions).


Integrate Django with React:

Use Django's REST framework to expose APIs for CRUD operations on Sudoku puzzles.
Make HTTP requests from React components to interact with the Django backend.


Build the Sudoku Solver:

Implement an algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. Use backtracking or other techniques.
Expose an endpoint in Django to receive puzzle data, solve it, and return the solution.


Connect Frontend and Backend:

Implement the necessary logic in React to send puzzle data to the Django backend for solving.
Display the solved puzzle returned from the backend to the user.


UI/UX Design:

Design and style React components to create a user-friendly interface.
Make sure the UI is responsive and works well on different devices.


Testing and Deployment:

Test web app to ensure all features work as expected.
Deploy Django backend and React frontend to a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean).


Optional Enhancements:

Add features like difficulty levels for generated puzzles.
Implement user authentication to allow users to save their progress or compete with others.
Add features like hints or error checking for incorrect solutions.
